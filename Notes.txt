Introduction To Microservices:
	
Application
	-Monolithic
		A monolithik application is a single-tiered software application.Has user interface and data access 		code combined into a single program from a single platform.
		
		Challanges:
			-Large codebase become mess over the time
			-Multiple team working on single codebase become tedious
			-Scaling up certain parts of the application
			-Technology updates/rewrite become complex and expensive tasks.
	-Microservices
		-An engeneering approach focused on decomposing applications with well-defined interfaces.
		-Deployed independently as services and operated by small teams who own the entire lifecycle of the 		service.
		-Each service handles a specific business domain(logging,auth,orders,customers)
		-Each service provides the implementation for user interface ,business logic and connection to 		database;
		

	-Characteristics of Micro Service
		-Single function
		-Well defined interface
		-Independent
		-Small Team
		-Entire Lifecycle
